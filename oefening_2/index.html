                <p>Petzold is one of Microsoft’s Seven Windows Pioneers and has been writing about programming since
                    1984.
                    First published in 2000, his book about code itself is a perennial favorite in the coding world
                    thanks
                    to its readable explanation of how programming and code are built into the fabric of everyday life.
                    Petzold explains coding and assembly language for a general audience using familiar concepts such as
                    Braille and Morse code. Better still, the book is illustrated, helping even those who don’t consider
                    themselves code-savvy to follow along through the whole thing.</p>

                <p>At its most basic, hacking is simply the art of problem-solving. Sometimes a problem calls for an
                    unconventional solution, and sometimes that solution involves exploiting holes in someone else’s
                    programming. Readers can gain an overview of the world of the best computer programming books from
                    the
                    hacker’s perspective, including such techniques as hijacking network communications and exploiting
                    weaknesses in cryptography. Using the included diagrams and easy-to-follow text, readers can try
                    their
                    hands at a variety of existing hacking techniques.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The expression “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should,” is all too applicable to bad coding.
                    Sure, it might function, but messy code will inevitably make more work for someone else – maybe even
                    yourself! Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship trains with examples, so be
                    prepared to
                    do more than just read about helpful tips and tricks. Not only will you learn what constitutes good
                    code, Martin includes portions of code for analysis, helping you further your understanding of good
                    and
                    bad techniques. While the code you will be inspecting is primarily Java-based, the principles you
                    will
                    learn in this book can be applied to any coding language.</p>

                <p>Mitnick, the author of the bestseller Ghost in the Wires, calls himself “the world’s most famous
                    hacker.”
                    His hacking career began at age 13 when he hacked a punch card system to ride the bus around Los
                    Angeles
                    for free. A former black hatter wanted by the FBI, he spent five years in prison for wire fraud and
                    other crimes from 1995-2000. Mitnick now teaches the general public about invisibility in the age of
                    Big
                    Data. Those who are new to programming can follow along with the simple, step-by-step advice
                    presented
                    in this book. For more advanced readers, Mitnick and Vamosi present “elite” privacy hacks.</p>

                <p>Design patterns are useful in all languages and all code bases. If you don’t have a fundamental
                    understanding of design patterns, this programming book is a great primer to help you start writing
                    better code. At any given moment, someone struggles with the same software design problems you have.
                    And, chances are, someone else has already solved your problem. Learning JavaScript Design Patterns
                    shows you the tried-and-true, road-tested patterns used by developers.</p>

                <p>Originally released in 1999, this book has been a consistent bestseller among programmers, as well as
                    a
                    university coursebook. The material stays fresh by weaving in short stories and anecdotes as it
                    provides
                    valuable advice for software developers. When it was released, this book also helped popularize a
                    number
                    of coding terms and expressions. How is this relevant to you? Well, a new edition – The Pragmatic
                    Programmer: your journey to mastery – will be released in September 2019 for the book’s 20th
                    anniversary, complete with extensive overhaul to the source material. If the original was good, this
                    is
                    better. Not only is it updated to reflect the new realities of tech – about a third of the book is
                    entirely new information – but the rest of the text has been edited for clarity.</p>

                <p>AI programming and neural networks are all the buzz right now. Although the more hands-on portions of
                    this book focus on Python programming, at its heart this book is about the mathematics that
                    underlies
                    neural networks in general. Neural networks are the foundation of artificial intelligence and deep
                    learning. This is one of the best coding books to introduce readers to the concept of neural
                    networks
                    with clear, easy to follow examples. After reading this book, even those without much exposure to
                    Python
                    programming will come away with a working knowledge of neural network implementation.</p>

                <p>Althoff is a self-taught programmer who took a job at eBay, only to find there was still a tremendous
                    amount to learn to be a professional programmer. This book is one of the best programming books for
                    beginners learning to program, but even more than that, it’s for all self-taught programmers to
                    expand
                    and polish their skills to a professional level. Topics include object-oriented computer programming
                    for
                    beginners, using coding to build a web scraper, the fundamentals of computer architecture and
